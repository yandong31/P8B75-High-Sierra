<p><font size="1">The SYSCALL and SYSRET instructions are designed for operating systems that use a flat
memory model (segmentation is not used). The instructions, along with SYSENTER and
SYSEXIT, are suited for IA-32e mode operation.</font></p>
<p><font size="1">SYSCALL is intended for use by user code running at privilege level 3 to access operating
system or executive procedures running at privilege level 0. SYSRET is intended for use by
privilege level 0 operating system or executive procedures for fast returns to privilege level 3
user code.</font></p>
