	<p><font size="1">This tab displays information about the processor's cache.&nbsp; 
	There are two types of information listed, explicit and non-explicit.&nbsp; 
	The CPUID instruction has two different cache information calls, one for 
	getting the explicit information (e.g. cache level, number of ways, line 
	size, etc.) about each cache and another which is an array of 8-bit 
	identifiers used to identify the cache information.</font></p>
	<p><font size="1">The explicit cache information is useful for calculating 
	the size of a cache in the event of the programmer wanting to limit data to 
	certain sizes (i.e. limiting the amount of data being worked on at any given 
	time to avoid thrashing the cache).&nbsp; The non-explicit cache information 
	is purely for informational purposes.</font></p>
	<p><font size="1"><i>CLFLUSH Line Size</i> specifies the number of bytes 
	that gets flushed from the cache when issuing the CLFLUSH instruction.&nbsp; 
	This is typically the same as the actual line size of the cache and is 
	naturally aligned to the number of bytes specified.</font></p>
