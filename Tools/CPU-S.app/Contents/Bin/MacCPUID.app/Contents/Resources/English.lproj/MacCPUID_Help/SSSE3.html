<p><font size="1">SSSE3 provide 32 instructions (represented by 14 mnemonics) to accelerate computations
on packed integers. These include:
<br>
• Twelve instructions that perform horizontal addition or subtraction operations.<br>
• Six instructions that evaluate absolute values.<br>
• Two instructions that perform multiply and add operations and speed up the evaluation of dot products.<br>
• Two instructions that accelerate packed-integer multiply operations and produce integer values with scaling.<br>
• Two instructions that perform a byte-wise, in-place shuffle according to the second shuffle control operand.<br>
• Six instructions that negate packed integers in the destination operand if the signs of the corresponding element in the source operand is less than zero.<br>
• Two instructions that align data from the composite of two operands.<br>
