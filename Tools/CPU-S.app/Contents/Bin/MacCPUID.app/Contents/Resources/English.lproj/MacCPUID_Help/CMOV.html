<p><font size="1">The CMOVcc instructions check the state of one or more of the 
status flags in the EFLAGS
register (CF, OF, PF, SF, and ZF) and perform a move operation if the flags are 
in a specified
state (or condition). A condition code (cc) is associated with each instruction 
to indicate the
condition being tested for. If the condition is not satisfied, a move is not 
performed and execution 
continues with the instruction following the CMOVcc instruction.</font></p>
<p><font size="1">In 
addition, if x87 FPU is present as indicated by the CPUID.FPU feature bit, then 
the FCOMI and FCMOV instructions are also supported.</font></p>
