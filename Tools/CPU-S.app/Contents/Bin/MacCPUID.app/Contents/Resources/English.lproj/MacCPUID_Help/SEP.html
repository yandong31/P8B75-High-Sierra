<p><font size="1">The SYSENTER and SYSEXIT instructions were introduced into the IA-32 architecture in the
Pentium II processors for the purpose of providing a fast (low overhead) mechanism for calling
operating system or executive procedures. SYSENTER is intended for use by user code running
at privilege level 3 to access operating system or executive procedures running at privilege level
0. SYSEXIT is intended for use by privilege level 0 operating system or executive procedures
for fast returns to privilege level 3 user code.</font></p>
<p><font size="1">For processors supporting Intel® EM64T, the SYSENTER and SYSEXIT instructions are
enhanced to allow fast system calls from user code running at privilege level 3 (in compatibility
mode or 64-bit mode) to 64-bit executive procedures running at privilege level 0.</p>
