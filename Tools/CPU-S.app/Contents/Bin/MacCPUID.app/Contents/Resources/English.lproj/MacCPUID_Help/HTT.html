<p><font size="1">Hyper-Threading (HT) Technology was developed to improve the performance of IA-32 processors
when executing multi-threaded operating system and application code or single-threaded

processor to execute two or more separate code streams (threads) concurrently using shared
execution resources.</font></p>
