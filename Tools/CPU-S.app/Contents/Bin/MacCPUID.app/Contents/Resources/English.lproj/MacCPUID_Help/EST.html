<p><font size="1">Enhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology can manage processor power consumption
efficiently via performance state transitions. Processor performance states are defined as
discrete operating points associated with different frequencies.</font></p>
<p><font size="1">Previous generations of the Intel SpeedStep® Technology require processors to be a deep sleep
state, holding off bus master transfers for the duration of a performance state transition. Performance
state transitions under the Enhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology are discrete transitions
to a new target frequency.</font></p>
