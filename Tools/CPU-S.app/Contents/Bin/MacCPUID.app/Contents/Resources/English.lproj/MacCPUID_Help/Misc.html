	<p><font size="2">This tab displays other pertinent CPUID information not 
	falling under the other categories.&nbsp; The following describes the 
	different items potentially listed in this tab:</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">
		<b>Processor Threads</b><br>
		<i>Logical Processors per Core</i> specifies how many logical processors 
		there are in a processor core.<br>
		<i>Cores per Physical Package</i> specifies how many microprocessor cores 
		there are in a physical package.
	</font></p>
	<p><font size="2"><b>Monitor/MWait Leaf</b><br>
		<i>Smallest Line Size</i> specifies the smallest address line size the 
		MONITOR/MWAIT instructions examine.<br>
		<i>Largest Line Size</i> specifies the largest address line size the 
		MONITOR/MWAIT instructions examine.<br>
		<i>Interrupts Treated as Break-Event</i> specifies that the processor treats 
		interrupts as a break-event for MWAIT even when interrupts are disabled.
	</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">
		<b>Thermal and Power Management Leaf</b><br>
		<i>Number of Interrupt Thresholds</i> specifies how many interrupt thersholds
		there are for the digital thermal sensor.<br>
		<i>ACNT/MCNT</i> specifies the capability to provide a measure of delivered
		processor performance (since the last reset of the counters), as a percentage
		of expected processor performance at the frequency specified in the CPUID Brand String.
	</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">
		<b>Address Sizes</b><br>
		<i>Physical Address</i> specifies the largest physical address the processor 
		is capable of.<br>
		<i>Logical Address</i> specifies the largest logical address the processor 
		is capable of.
